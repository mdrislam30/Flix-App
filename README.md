# Flix-App
Flix- a movie browsing app that takes data from the web and displays the list of popular movies.
For this unit's app assignment, you'll build the first part of a movie browsing app--similar to Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes--that lets a user view and scroll through a list of movies. To do this, you'll learn how to get data from the internet (via an API) and display it in a scrollable list in your app; two core concepts you'll use in virtually every app you'll ever build!

    User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
    User can view and scroll through a list of movies now playing in theaters.
    User can view the movie posters in each row.
