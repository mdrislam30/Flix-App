# Flix-App
Flix- a movie browsing app that takes data from the web and displays the list of popular movies.

    Get a list of movies--including info about each movie, i.e. title, description and movie poster image.
        To get our movie info, we'll work with a web based API whose purpose is to send back whatever data we request. APIs are how all mobile apps get data from the web, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter...if it accesses the internet, it's accessing an API. Every project in this course will pull in data from a web based API, however you do NOT need to know the ins-and-outs of APIs to use them, just like you don't need to know the ins-and-outs of how a car's engine works to drive one. All you'll need to know is a few basic concepts and terms which we'll cover in the walkthough videos as we build the app--so buckle up, grab the wheel and let's burn some API rubber! üèé
    Display each movie in a way that allows a user to scroll up and down to see all movies.
        Once we get our movie list and info, we'll want to display are movies for the user to view. Since we'll have more movies then we can fit on the screen, we'll need to make the list scrollable. Every app has a scrollable view somewhere--think of your facebook news feed, instagram feed, twitter feed...even your settings screen. Thankfully, iOS features a pre-made view for exactly this application, all we have to do is set it up. Enter, the Table View: a view that allows us to take any list of things--movies, tweets, posts, snaps--and display each thing in it's own space on the screen. It also allows users to scroll up and down to their hearts content in order to view everything on the list.
